            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Anja and I'm a fourth year honours electrical engineering student at McGill University in Montreal, QC. I am currently planning to begin my graduate studies next fall in electrical engineering with a research focus on machine learning and signal processing. I've been fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct research with <u><a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/mark-coates">Prof. Mark Coates</a></u>, <u><a href="https://inrs.ca/en/research/professors/douglas-oshaughnessy/">Prof. Douglas O'Shaugnessy</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~clark/">Prof. James Clark</a></u>, and <u><a href="https://borisvaisband.wixsite.com/think-team/the-team">Prof. Boris Vasiband</a></u> at McGill.</p>
            <p>Outside of school, I love all things nature and often find time to hike, bike, and ski. I volunteer within the McGill community as a student advocate for 1200 students, a manager to a team of 60 people, an event planner managing 20k budgets, and a peer mentor to other women in EE. As a random fun fact completely unrelated to EE, I love politics and world news and have read the New York Times every day for the last 8 years :) </p>

            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>In my research, I seek to explore how ML can be used to transform the classical EE fields of signal processing, networking, communication systems. I particularly enjoy statistics and algorithmic development. I am currently seeking admittance to MS and PhD programs in the fields of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. After graduate studies, I plan to enter industry working in advanced research and development. </p>
            <p>My ongoing bachelor’s thesis is with Prof. Mark Coates on the topic of evaluation methods for categorical generative models, a type of unsupervised machine learning. The research proposes an algorithm to rank the performance of categorical generative models over very large sample spaces (of order 1616) and is based on statistical first principles and hypothesis testing. Planned future work involves applying this research to the task of protein sequence modeling. The results of my work were submitted recently to the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2023) and are under review.</p>
