            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Anja and I'm a fourth year honours electrical engineering student at McGill University in Montreal, QC. I am currently planning to begin my graduate studies next fall in electrical engineering with a research focus on machine learning and signal processing. I've been fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct research with Prof. Mark Coates, Prof. Douglas O'Shaugnessy, Prof. James Clark, and Prof. Boris Vasiband at McGill.</p>
            <p>Outside of school, I love all things nature and often find time to hike, bike, and ski. I volunteer within the McGill community as a student advocate representing 1200 ECSE students, an event planner managing 20k+ budgets, and a peer mentor to other women in EE. As a random fun fact completely uncorrelated to EE, I love politics and world news and have read the New York Times every day for the last 8 years :) </p>
