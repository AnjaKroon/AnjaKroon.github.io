            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my page! I am a fourth-year honours electrical engineering student at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada applying to MS/PhD programs in the US and Europe for electrical engineering. My research interest areas include machine learning and signal processing applied to medicine, biology and communications. </p>
            <p>I have been fortunate enough to conduct research internships in various fields ranging from heterogeneous integration, signal processing and machine learning. My past work has resulted in a published paper presented at IEEE ISCAS 2022 on power delivery systems in a novel heterogeneous integration technology supervised by Prof. Vaisband. I have also investigated the intersection of signal processing and ML through a research project comparing pitch detection algorithms. That work has been published on ArXiv with test scripts available on GitHub. My other research experiences have included investigations in computer vision and silicon photonic switching.</p>
            <p>This past summer, I sought to learn more about the crossover between ML and signal processing and worked in my spare time with Prof. Coates on evaluation methods for generative models as a baseline evaluation metric for generative protein sequence modeling. This research work will continue in September 2022 as the topic of my bachelorâ€™s thesis.</p>
