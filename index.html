            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Anja and I'm a fourth year honours electrical engineering student at McGill University in Montreal, QC. I am currently planning to begin my graduate studies next fall in electrical engineering with a research focus on machine learning and signal processing. I've been fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct research with Prof. Mark Coates, Prof. Douglas O'Shaugnessy, Prof. James Clark, and Prof. Boris Vasiband at McGill.</p>
            <p>Outside of school, I love all things nature and often find time to hike, bike, and ski. I volunteer within the McGill community as a student advocate representing 1200 ECSE students, an event planner managing 20k+ budgets, and a peer mentor to other women in EE. As a random fun fact completely uncorrelated to EE, I love politics and world news and have read the New York Times every day for the last 8 years :) </p>
            
            <h2>Publications</h2>
            <h3>Anja Kroon, “Comparing Conventional Pitch Detection Algorithms with a Neural Network Approach”</h3>
            Research project in ECSE 523: Speech Communications with Prof. Douglas O’Shaugnessy. Presented to course.<br>
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14357">ArXiv.</a>

            <h3>Yousef Safari, Anja Kroon, and Boris Vaisband, “Power Delivery for Ultra-Large-Scale Applications on Si-IF”</h3>
            Paper and poster at IEEE International Symposium of Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) May 2022.<br>
            <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13034">ArXiv.</a>

            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>My research interests are in machine learning and signal processing applied to medicine, biology, and communications. I see machine learning as a tool that can transform signal processing and its applications. I find meaning in making impactful technological innovations that improve the daily lives of people around the world. It is thus my objective to do graduate school research at the MS and PhD levels. I plan tocontinue afterwards with a career in advanced research and development in industry. <br>
            This year, I am excited to conduct my honours EE bachelor's thesis with Prof. Mark Coates of McGill University in evaluation methods for generative models to improve generative proteins sequence modeling.</p>
