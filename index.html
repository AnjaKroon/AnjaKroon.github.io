            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hello! I am currently a fourth-year honors electrical engineering student at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Next year, I am beginning my graduate school journey by obtaining my MS and PhD in electrical engineering. My research interest areas include signal processing for edge devices utilizing machine learning frameworks. I've been fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct research with <u><a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/mark-coates">Prof. Mark Coates</a></u>, <u><a href="https://inrs.ca/en/research/professors/douglas-oshaughnessy/">Prof. Douglas O'Shaugnessy</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~clark/">Prof. James Clark</a></u>, and <u><a href="https://borisvaisband.wixsite.com/think-team/the-team">Prof. Boris Vasiband</a></u> at McGill.</p>
            <p>Outside of school, I love all things nature and often find time to hike, bike, and ski. I volunteer within the McGill community as a student advocate for 1200 students, a manager to a team of 60+ volunteers, an event planner managing 20k budgets, and a peer mentor to other women in EE. As a random fun fact completely unrelated to EE, I love politics and world news and have read the New York Times every day for the last 8 years :) </p>

            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>In my research, I wish to explore how ML can be used to transform the classical EE fields of signal processing, networking, and communication systems. I particularly enjoy statistics and algorithmic development. Next year, I will be attending the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. After graduate studies, I plan to enter industry working in advanced research and development. </p>
            <p>My bachelor’s thesis recently commenced with Professor Mark Coates on the topic of evaluation methods for categorical generative models, a type of unsupervised machine learning. The research proposes binning, an algorithm to evaluate the performance of categorical generative models over very large sample spaces (of order 10<sup>9</sup>) and is based on statistical identity testing literature. The binning metric provides correct, meaningful, and interpretable results with statistical guarantees which outperform baselines. The binning method is verified on the real world task of generative protein sequence modeling. A paper is published in the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2023). A second paper is under review with Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI) 2023. </p>
